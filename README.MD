## Context

We are building a new Core Feature called **GPS Tracking** for a mobile/web application.
This feature allows users to share, update, and view real-time locations of themselves and their family members.
The backend is implemented in Node.js/Express and Firebase Realtime Database, using `location.controller.js` which includes:

- updateLocation()
- getMyLocation()
- getFamilyLocations()
- getUserLocation()
- removeLocation()

We are currently in “Phase 1: Feature Analysis & Selection (15')” — the goal is to analyze why GPS Tracking is chosen, and identify core functions to test.

## Goal

Design the **Core Feature Summary Slide** for “GPS Tracking”.
The slide must include:

1. **Why choose GPS Tracking?** (business logic & technical reasons)
2. **Functions to test** (from the controller logic)
   Output must follow the Markdown hybrid format below.

## Constraints

- The reasons must be realistic and measurable (e.g. “Relevance to real-world apps”, “Includes concurrency or sync challenges”, “Firebase integration logic”, etc.).
- The functions must be atomic and testable.

## Workflow

1. Generate 3 candidate outlines for the GPS Tracking slide (each with "Why choose" + "Functions to test" + code sample).
2. Score each using the rubric.
3. Select the top 2.
4. Refine them by merging strengths.
5. Output the final structured result below.

Rules:

- Output **only** the structured Markdown content, no raw internal reasoning.
- Keep style minimalistic and presentation-ready (for slide use).






## Why Choose GPS Tracking?

**Business & Product Logic**

- Family Safety: Enables families to view members’ real-time locations (useful for “Find My Family”-like apps).
- Market Relevance: Location sharing is a core part of modern lifestyle & logistics apps (Grab, Life360, Zalo).
- User Engagement: Promotes trust, safety, and daily interaction inside family/community features.

**Technical Rationale**

- Real-time Synchronization: Uses Firebase Realtime DB for instant data propagation.
- Concurrency Handling: Supports multi-user updates & socket-based push to family members.
- Secure Access Control: Validates access only to authorized users/family members.
- Test Coverage Potential: Involves validation, async DB ops, socket emission, and error handling paths.

## Functions to Test

| Function               | Purpose                              | Test Focus                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `updateLocation()`     | Update user's current position       | Input validation, Firebase write, socket broadcast |
| `getMyLocation()`      | Fetch current user's location        | Correct retrieval & structure                      |
| `getFamilyLocations()` | Fetch all family members’ locations  | Batch queries, missing users handling              |
| `getUserLocation()`    | Fetch one specific member’s location | Access validation & correctness                    |
| `removeLocation()`     | Delete user’s location               | Deletion success, socket removal event             |
