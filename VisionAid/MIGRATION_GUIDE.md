# üîÑ Migration Guide: TTS to Pre-Recorded Audio

## Overview
This guide details the migration from `expo-speech` TTS system to pre-recorded audio using `AudioManager` and `VoiceServiceAudio`.

## üìã Migration Steps

### Step 1: Install Required Dependencies (‚úÖ Already Done)
```bash
# expo-av is already installed for audio playback

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Before Migration
- [x] Document current TTS behavior
- [x] Test all screens with expo-speech
- [x] Note any timing issues
- [x] Capture baseline performance metrics

### After Migration
- [ ] **Step 1**: Record all 30 audio files (see `AUDIO_RECORDING_GUIDE.md`)
- [ ] **Step 2**: Place audio files in correct directories
- [ ] **Step 3**: Update all imports to use VoiceServiceAudio
- [ ] **Step 4**: Initialize AudioManager in app startup
- [ ] **Step 5**: Test each screen individually

## üö® Breaking Changes

### ‚ùå Removed Functionality
1. **expo-speech dependency**: Will be removed from package.json
2. **TTS voice selection**: No longer needed (single professional voice)
3. **Speech rate adjustment**: Replaced with playback speed (0.8x-1.2x)
4. **Dynamic text-to-speech**: Must use pre-recorded audio only

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Behavior Changes
1. **Latency**: Pre-recorded audio starts faster (<100ms vs ~300ms for TTS)
2. **Quality**: Professional voice quality (vs synthetic TTS)
3. **Offline**: Works fully offline once audio loaded (TTS required processing)
4. **Priority**: New priority system with interruption logic
5. **Consistency**: Exact same voice/tone every time (TTS varied)

## üîß Code Migration Script

Run this script to update all imports automatically:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Navigate to project root
cd /home/phuc/FPT/VIsionAid/VisionAid/VisionAid

# Find and replace old VoiceService imports with new one
find . -type f \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" \) \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
  -not -path "*/src/services/VoiceService.ts" \
  -exec sed -i "s|from '@/src/services/VoiceService'|from '@/src/services/VoiceServiceAudio'|g" {} +

# Alternative: If using relative paths
find . -type f \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" \) \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
  -exec sed -i "s|from '../../src/services/VoiceService'|from '../../src/services/VoiceServiceAudio'|g" {} +

echo "‚úÖ Import migration complete!"
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Please verify changes before committing"
```

---

## üì¶ App.tsx / _layout.tsx Updates

### Initialize AudioManager on App Start

**Location**: `/app/_layout.tsx`

**Add to root layout**:

```typescript
import { audioManager } from '@/src/services/AudioManager';
import { voiceService } from '@/src/services/VoiceServiceAudio';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function RootLayout() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Initialize audio system
    const initAudio = async () => {
      try {
        await audioManager.initialize();
        await voiceService.initialize();
        console.log('‚úÖ Audio system initialized');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('‚ùå Audio initialization failed:', error);
      }
    };

    initAudio();

    // Cleanup on unmount
    return () => {
      audioManager.stop();
    };
  }, []);

  // ... rest of layout
}
```

## üóëÔ∏è Clean Up Old Dependencies

After migration is complete and tested:

```bash
# Remove expo-speech (no longer needed)
npm uninstall expo-speech

# Update package.json
npm install
```

---

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Metric | TTS (Old) | Pre-Recorded (New) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Start Latency** | ~300ms | ~50ms |
| **Voice Quality** | Synthetic | Professional |
| **Consistency** | Variable | Exact |
| **Offline Support** | Limited | Full |
| **File Size** | 0 KB | ~5 MB total |
| **CPU Usage** | High | Low |
| **Battery Impact** | Higher | Lower |

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Audio Not Playing
**Symptom**: Silent app, no audio feedback
**Solution**:
1. Check audio files exist in `/assets/audio/`
2. Verify filenames match AudioManager.ts exactly
3. Check device volume is up
4. Verify audioManager.initialize() was called
5. Check console for file loading errors

### Issue 2: Audio Overlap
**Symptom**: Multiple audio files playing simultaneously
**Solution**:
1. Verify priority system is working
2. Check shouldInterruptCurrentAudio() logic
3. Ensure only one Sound instance plays at a time
4. Add more aggressive stop() calls before play()

### Issue 3: Delayed Audio Start
**Symptom**: Long pause before audio plays
**Solution**:
1. Verify audio files are preloaded with preloadCommonAudio()
2. Check file sizes (should be <200KB each)
3. Optimize MP3 encoding
4. Load audio on app startup, not on first use

### Issue 4: Audio Cut Off
**Symptom**: Audio stops abruptly mid-playback
**Solution**:
1. Check for competing audio from navigation/gestures
2. Verify priority levels are correct
3. Add onComplete callbacks to track issues
4. Increase buffer size if needed

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues during migration:
1. Check console logs for audio loading errors
2. Verify audio files exist and are named correctly
3. Test individual audio files using audioManager.play() directly
4. Check ACCESSIBILITY_TESTING.md for test procedures
5. Review this migration guide for missed steps
